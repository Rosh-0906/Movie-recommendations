# ORACLE - AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

The ORACLE project enhances AI-driven personalization for movie recommendations by analyzing behavioral patterns, ratings, and sentiment analysis to provide refined and engaging matches, thereby improving the user experience. [cite: 126, 127]

## Objectives

The project aims to:

* Develop a hybrid recommendation model that combines collaborative and content-based filtering. [cite: 128]
* Increase recommendation accuracy using user sentiment analysis from reviews. [cite: 129]
* Ensure adaptability with self-learning AI models that dynamically refine suggestions. [cite: 129]
* Compare various machine learning approaches to optimize performance. [cite: 130]

## Project Workflow

The project workflow is as follows:

1.  **Start:** Initiate the process. [cite: 131]
2.  **Data Collection:** Gather movie details and user preferences. [cite: 131]
3.  **Data Processing:** Clean and encode relevant data features. [cite: 132]
4.  **EDA & Insights:** Analyze user-movie interactions to identify patterns. [cite: 132]
5.  **Feature Engineering:** Enhance input data for improved recommendations. [cite: 133]
6.  **Model Building:** Implement and evaluate recommendation algorithms. [cite: 133]
7.  **Deployment & Visualization:** Present AI-driven movie suggestions. [cite: 134]
8.  **User Feedback Loop:** Refine recommendations based on user engagement. [cite: 134]

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

* Movie metadata (genres, ratings, cast, director, release year). [cite: 135, 136]
* User preferences (watch history, likes, dislikes). [cite: 136]
* Review sentiments (text analysis for emotional tone). [cite: 137]
* Streaming platform trends (popularity rankings). [cite: 137]

## Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps are applied:

* Handling missing values (imputation). [cite: 137, 138]
* Encoding categorical features (genres, cast). [cite: 138]
* Processing text for sentiment analysis (tokenization, stop-word removal). [cite: 138, 139]
* Feature scaling & normalization for enhanced model performance. [cite: 139]

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves:

* Analyzing genre-watch frequency trends. [cite: 139, 140]
* Mapping correlations between ratings and user engagement. [cite: 140]
* Segmenting user behavior through clustering. [cite: 140]
* Sentiment-based polarity scoring. [cite: 140, 141]

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering includes:

* Creating user-movie interaction matrices. [cite: 141]
* TF-IDF feature extraction. [cite: 141]
* Embedding-based similarity measures. [cite: 142]
* Contextual tagging. [cite: 142]

## Model Building

The project compares the following approaches:

* Matrix Factorization (SVD). [cite: 143]
* Neural Collaborative Filtering. [cite: 143]
* Hybrid Approach. [cite: 144]
* Graph-based models. [cite: 144]

## Visualization of Results & Model Insights

The results are visualized using:

* Heatmaps for similarity tracking. [cite: 145]
* Feature importance rankings. [cite: 145]
* Precision-recall curves. [cite: 146]
* Confusion matrices. [cite: 146]

## Tools and Technologies Used

* **Python:** Primary language for data handling and model building. [cite: 147, 148]
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For efficient preprocessing and feature engineering. [cite: 148, 149]
